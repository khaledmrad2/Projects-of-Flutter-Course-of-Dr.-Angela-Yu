# Dicee App

Dicee is an app made through The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with
Dart by Angela Yu on Udemy.

The idea of the program depends on the practical application of the concept 
of new widgets such as Expanded, Padding, and TextButton (formerly FlatButton), 
in addition to dealing with the difference between Stateful and Stateless Widgets
in Flutter framework, dealing with Math library in Dart language, 
and how to add functionality to widgets through onPressed and setState functions.

Once you press one of the two dice, the result is generated randomly.
This app is useful for random draw games when you don't have real
dice like Monopoly. And sometimes in the study of probability and statistics 
when applied to random experiments such as dice.
