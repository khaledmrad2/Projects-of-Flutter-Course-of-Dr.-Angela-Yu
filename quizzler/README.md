# Quizzler App

A new Flutter project.

Quizzler is an app made through The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp 
with Dart by Angela Yu on Udemy.
The idea of the application is a test game of 12 questions only.
It is based on the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming 
(OOP) concepts in Dart language, such as Classes, Objects, Abstraction, 
Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. It is also based on Widgets,
adding functionality to all buttons and the entire application, and also using the 
rflutter_alert package to display notification at the end of the game.
