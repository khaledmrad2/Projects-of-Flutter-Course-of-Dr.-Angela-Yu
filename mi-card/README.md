# MiCard project

MiCard is one of the practical applications that were worked on in the Flutter
framework learning course by teacher Angela Yu on the Udemy platform.

It is mainly based on practical training and focuses on the concept
of widgets in a broader way for beginners. Many widgets have been used such as Scaffold,
SafeArea, Column, Row, Icon, Card, ListTile, Container, Text, SizedBox, CircleAvatar,
Divider. The concept of fonts was used.

The useful thing about this interface is the ability to download the source code
and modify it according to your taste, and it is useful later when
building applications in the About Us or Contact Us section.
