# BMI Calculator

the app is  made through The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp
with Dart by Angela Yu on Udemy.
The user can enter his gender, height, weight and age in order to 
obtain a result of calculating his body mass index so that he can
monitor his healthy lifestyle on a regular basis.
BMI Calculator is based on the practical application of several 
concepts in Dart language and Flutter Framework, such as Enum Classes,
Maps, Composition and Inheritance, Functions as First Order Objects, 
GestureDetector, Slider, Navigator, ThemeData in MaterialApp and how we
can make a custom Theme Widget , Extract a Flutter Widget with Refactor
and many more side information.
Most of the colors that were used in the application are in the hexadecimal
system, and  font_awesome_flutter package was used for some icons in 
order to improve the UI Design. The project is organized, store constants,
and add functionality in separate Dart files that interact with each other
using OOP and Navigator concepts
