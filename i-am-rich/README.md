# I am rich project

A new Flutter project.
In the early days of the App Store when it was still very much the Wild West
of app development, a guy called Arman decided to create an app called "I Am Rich".
And It was a pretty clever idea. 
He decided that he was going to make an app that basically does absolutely nothing.
It just shows a single icon of a red ruby on the screen and he decide to price 
it at the maximum possible price at the App Store would allow which was nine hundred 
and ninety nine point nine nine dollars and he pitched it as an art and lifestyle app
for people are very rich to display to other people how rich they are.

I present to you the same idea of   the application for free,
and it is one of the applications that was worked on through the videos of the Learning 
Framework for Flutter course by teacher Angela Yu on the Udemy platform. 
The idea of   the application depends solely on the practical application of widget 
concepts such as Scaffold, AppBar, Text, and AssetImage.
It is easy and simple and very suitable for anyone who is a beginner who wants 
to learn the framework and the practical application at the same time.
