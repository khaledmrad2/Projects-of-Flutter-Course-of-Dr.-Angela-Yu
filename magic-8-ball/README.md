# Magic 8 Ball

AMagic 8 Ball is an app made through The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp 
with Dart by Angela Yu on Udemy.

The idea of   the program is the same as the idea of   
the Dicee application in the previous post, based on the principle of Stateful Widgets 
with the addition of functionality to widgets through onPressed and setState functions.
The ability to shake the phone has also been added, in addition to pressing the ball to give a
result via shake package.

The Magic 8 Ball is a plastic sphere, made to look like an oversized eight ball,
that is used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. It was invented in 1946 by Albert C.
Carter and Abe Bookman and is currently manufactured by Mattel.
The user asks a yesâ€“no question to the ball, then turns it over to reveal an answer
that floats up into a window.
